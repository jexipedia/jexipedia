ðŸ‘‹ About Me
I'm a self-taught student with a deep interest in theoretical physics, quantum field theory (QFT), Linux, networking, cybersecurity, and Python. While still in high school, I dedicate my time to learning beyond the traditional curriculum, focusing on complex systems, security, and the underlying principles of computing and physics.

Iâ€™m always looking to expand my knowledge, work on challenging projects, and connect with like-minded individuals.

ðŸ”¹ Fields of Interest:

Theoretical Physics & QFT
Linux & Networking
Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking
Python Development
Let's build, break, and secure the future. ðŸš€
